                    Fish out of water-
                    water of life,
                    trapped in a bottle, 
                    to swallow my pride.
                    Neat on the table,
                    glass and phone lain
                    Last of the night 
                    though nothing has changed.
                    Still waiting. 
                    Waiting for a chime. 
                    Biding my time with a scroll and some mimes
                    Head bowed, refraining from eyes,
                    or glued to the screening of rival campaign
                    Too loud to know the words iâ€™m relaying
                    have no relation with the game that is playing.
