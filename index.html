            Fish out of water-
            water of life,
            trapped in a bottle, 
            to swallow my pride.
            Neat on the table,
            glass and phone lain,
            last of the night 
            though nothing has changed.
            Still waiting. 
            Waiting for a chime. 
            Biding my time with a scroll and some mimes-
            head bowed, refraining from eyes-
            or glued to the screening of rival campaign.
            Too loud to know the words i’m relaying
            have no relation with the game that is playing.

            I’ve found an answer but i won’t stop looking.
            I’ve found an answer controversial and true.
            It holds no merit yet wields nothing save facts
            I’ve found an answer unique to the question.
            I’ve found an answer for the inquiring mind

            <pre>
            Deep pressing ice elation. 
            New suns
            Youth in eyes
                ...

            <pre>
            June’s freckles, invited by heat,
            Gingerly peek through, bridging effervescent cheeks. 
            Below russet eyes, 
                ...

            <pre>
            Sequestered in a sea of people. 
            Stagnant in the passage of time. 
            Imperceptible to passers by. 
            A magicians assistant, 
            Never to reappear.

            I have myself a ring, though not upon my finger. 
            My life is not so fortunate to share that wondrous feature. 
            The fiery heat a common thing but passion be misnomer. 
            Raw emotion fueled decision to suffocate disclaimer. 
            Your ring leaves lines in contrast with the changing tones of summer,
            Though mine retains impression made year round beneath the cover. 
            Reminder of the naive things, attempts to soothe affliction. 
            Depression that would come and go if given due duration. 
            Time will hold the story although time has dulled the subject. 
            If only patience conquered, my ring would be just concept.

            <pre>
            I was a child then:
            captivated, awestruck by your 
            Aphroditean silhouette,
            paragon visage,
            scirenic charm, 
            and feminine wiles. 
            Professing my predilection
            in parallel with yours. 
            Symbiotic-
            in the utmost commensal form. 
            Yet despondency still dawned. 
            Derivative of deprival. 
            Amity past due ascension -
            not due, desiderate. 
            Now I’m no child. 
            Belated reciprocation relinquished,
            now unrequited in reverse.

            <pre>
            Plight:
            Pragmatic parley perverted-
            prevarications presented,
            platitudes provided-
            predictable product. 
            Prior provocation
            prohibited pacification. 
            Piercing perception 
            predicated post pardon:
            pariah.

            <h2>#10</h2>
            <pre>
            Reflection distorted,
            subject unkempt.
            Isolated thinking-
            entirely inept. 
            Stand there and ponder
            alternative solutions. 
            Leave empty handed,
            still firm resolutions. 
            How to proceed:
            Steel or twine?
            Ocean or sky?
            Chemistry or physics?
            Uncertain incision. 
            Postpone decision.

            <h2>#11</h2>
            <pre>
            Piercing light; it must be winter.
            Fallen snow reflecting a glimpse of the heavens' blinging radiance.
            I walk among the clouds, angels at my feet.
